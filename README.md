# How to Run this Project






### This Project is made using React (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend) by connecting it with PostgreSQL Database. Additionally I have added the feature of entering capatcha and OTP verification in Login form and Register form (with more fields and validation) respectively.

### Important Note

In this project database used belongs CDAC authority. So it will not run on another system. You may need to change DB address to run on another system (change here "server.js").
